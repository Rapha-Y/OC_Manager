This project will be an app made for original character (OC) management, where users may log in, create their own OCs and view other people's entries.

Project stages:

1. Create the core functionalities - Front end components for the login, feed, character management, profile, and its complementary features.

2. Create the database - Back end functionalities, to store users, characters and complementary info.

3. Create additional features - Chat, notifications, settings, etc.

For study and showcase of skills, only the first and second stages are necessary, the third is only to be developed if it's decided that the project is gonna be taken seriously and published.
